<b>Capture The Talent June 2022 OSINT CTF Writeup</b>

This repo covers 2PAC's experiences in the Capture The Talent OSINT CTF that occured in June 2020. The CTF was made by K3N4D4M5 and comprised of 6 questions that had to be completed sequentially. For a unexpected CTF, it was great!

# Results
2PAC placed First overall after completing the 6 questions the fastest. This is his first time coming in 1st!. The prize for First Place was: £20 donation in your name to The Cyber Helpline AND a CTF ticket (or £20 voucher for the merch shop if you've got one already)  AND some stickers. 

# CTF Questions and Solutions:

# Question 1

**Prompt**
_What is the name of this park?_

Flag: **VictoriaPark**

**Methodology**
For once, Google Lens worked as advertised and Yandex wasn't too helpful during a CTF. Locking Google Lens on just the truck returned multiple results from Jac's Coffee Facebook page. After comparing the images it was clear where the location was.

# Question 2

**Prompt**
_What year was the van manufactured?_

_You have three attempts at this one. After three, you will be locked out._

_You have been warned..._

Flag: **1975**

**Methodology**
On the Jac's Coffee Facebook there is a link to their website, which has an About Us section: https://www.jacscoffeevan.co.uk/about-us. The first sentence lets us know that: Our trusty steed is a 1975 Citroen H van. Giving us the flag

# Question 3

**Prompt**
_The creator of this challenge (K3N4D4M5) used to work in the same neighbourhood and liked to walk around this park on lunch breaks. How long does it take to walk from their old job to the café? (in minutes)_

_Caution! You have 5 attempts, and only 5, until you are locked out._

_Proceed with caution..._

_Flag format: integers only, for example: 9001_

Flag: **15**

**Methodology**
This was by far the most difficult question. Finding K3N4D4M5's real name was fairly quick with a google search which revealed the following LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezar-biegun-39a61061/

From here, I checked both previous restaurants and determined that Aurora Modern Eatery was the most likely answer because the other was too far to walk to Victoria Park. The challenge came because Google Maps would not plot out the flag. After trying to two recommended routes of 16 and 17 minutes, I went one minute of (18) and one minute under (15) before finding the flag. Because 16 and 17 didn't work however I spent a significant amount of time trying to find if there might be a different job that I should have been setting the walk route from.

# Question 4

**Prompt**
_What's the first and last name of the person who supplies coffee to this café?_

Flag: **DanielleHadley**

**Methodology**
Going Back to Jac's Coffee site we can see they have a page listing their suppliers. The first is Danielle's Coffee; having a name in the company title I figured that was a good place to start and looked on LinkedIn for their page. LinkedIn had an autogenerated page for them and listed two employees, including one with the title owner who was blocked to me but had the profile picture.

Google Lens Image searches on LinkedIn photos often returns interesting results. In this case google did the work for me and got the flag:

# Question 5

**Prompt**
_Where were they (coffee supplier) on the Easter day during the first UK covid-19 lockdown? We are looking for the name of the hamlet (place)._

Flag: **WhitcottKeysett**

**Methodology**
It's time to start digging more data on Danielle's Coffee. Starting at their Facebook page, we can easily search across specific dates: https://www.facebook.com/DaniellesCoffeeltd. All the photos from around Easter 2020 show's the owner in lockdown at a Farm somewhere but none of the posts provide a clear location:

But their Facebook does provide a link to their Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/daniellescoffee/. Scrolling through their instagram we can find these same photos but now geolocated to Whitcott Keysett. A funny side note, the msot recent checkin on their Facebook is in Whitcott Keysett as well.

# Question 6

**Prompt**
_Last challenge!_

_In the spring of 2022, a person walked the path near the aforementioned park. They smelled a particularly distinctive plant and posted about it on social media._

_What plant did they post about?_

Flag: **WildGarlic**

**Methodology**
With the hint that we should be looking at Social Media and I specific location, I tend to start with Twitter because it is easy to search. Here is the search string I used: _geocode:55.975110,-3.193501,0.5km until:2022-06-30 since:2022-02-15_ The Geocoord is the cent of Victoria Park and will cover out about a block and a half in all directions around the park. The third tweet with this string was:

I will mention I did waste a few minutes with the wrong search string. I initially thought this was another COVID lockdown question and was looking at photos from Spring 2020 before closely rereading the prompt. Always remember to read the prompt especially when the questions are related in different ways.
